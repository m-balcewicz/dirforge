# Presentations — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Project ID: {{PROJECT_ID}}

This folder contains slides, posters, and related presentation materials. By convention this folder should be kept flat (no nested subfolders) so that export tools and web previews can show assets directly.

Guidance:
- Name files clearly: `YYYYMMDD_event_title_v1.pptx` or `poster_event_title.pdf`.
- Keep source files and exported PDFs together where helpful, but avoid deep nesting.
