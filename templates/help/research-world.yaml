best_practices:
  - "Use descriptive PROJECT-ID that will make sense in 5 years"
  - "Include year prefix for chronological organization"
  - "Place large datasets in external storage with manifests in 03_data/"
  - "Use .integrity/checksums/ for data validation"
  - "Version control 04_analysis/ with Git"
  - "Document project structure in README.md"
